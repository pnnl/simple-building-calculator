            <p>The <strong>Simple Building Calculator (SBC) </strong> is a tool for small and simple commercial buildings to generate quick and interactive estimates of energy efficiency measures. </p>
            <p>SBC can evaluate whole-building or single measure savings in new or existing buildings, compare measure package choices, or provide simplified performance modeling for energy codes and utility incentives. </p>
            <p>The tool combines physical (annual whole building prototype simulation) and statistical modeling techniques to predict annual energy performance. It supports a variety of building characteristics for envelope, HVAC, and lighting with parameters ranging from vintage to maximum technology (max-tech) configurations, as well as support for single-zone and simple multi-zone HVAC systems. </p>
            <p>The Simple Building Calculator is designed to provide immediate feedback for otherwise computationally intensive tasks like measure comparison, development of multiple measure package combinations, or verification that measures meet efficiency targetsâ€”all with the goal of providing a tool for quick annual energy simulation of simple commercial buildings. </p>

            <h5>Impact</h5>
            <p>The <strong>Simple Building Calculator (SBC)</strong> has several practical applications such as providing a quick energy estimate for interactive savings in simple buildings. While the tool is not intended for precise results, it will compare interactive impact of various measure combinations quickly and allow selection of packages of integrated design options for simple commercial buildings to achieve target levels of energy efficiency compared to a standard baseline design without custom simulation. These savings can be applied to energy codes, utility incentive programs, building rating programs, or advanced design efforts. </p>
